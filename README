# Node js app : Dealing with files upload
Upload Files is really amusing when it's done using libraries, But this time i've been facing a problem with uploading images using Multer in one big project.
So finding a solution was mandatory to get over the situation.

# MVC Architecture : 
+ controllers
+ routes
+ validators
+ middleware
+ models and views are out of this scope

# Run the application
+ clone the github repo
+ change directory to the project folder
+ run `npm install` to install all dependencies
+ run `node index.js` to run the app

>Note : The app will run on the port 4000 `http://localhost:4000`
